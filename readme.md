A mashup of smoothie.js and brain.js. Thanks to the people who made both of those.

This whole thing is a gloriously pointless exercise: one of these lines on the graph is random (pseudorandom), the other one is determined by a neural network trained on randomness. A slight majority (110 / 200 of the Mechanical Turkers I tested) can tell which one is the neural network.
